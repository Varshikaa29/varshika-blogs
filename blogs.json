Here's a comprehensive guide to help you navigate through it!</p><h2>📚 Foundation Courses Overview</h2><p>The Foundation level consists of 8 courses divided into:</p><ul><li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Math 1 (Calculus) and Math 2 (Linear Algebra)</li><li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Stats 1 and Stats 2</li><li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python and Computational Thinking</li><li><strong>English:</strong> English 1 and English 2</li></ul><h2>⏰ Time Management Strategy</h2><p>I recommend taking 4 courses per term if you have other commitments. The workload is manageable but requires consistent effort. Allocate at least 2-3 hours daily for studies.</p><h2>📅 Exam Preparation</h2><p>Start revising 2 weeks before exams. Practice previous year questions - they give you a clear idea of the pattern. For programming, practice coding daily on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.</p><h2>🌟 Pro Tips</h2><ul><li>Watch all video lectures at 1.5x speed initially, then review difficult parts</li><li>Join Discord/Telegram groups for doubt solving</li><li>Complete assignments on time - they boost your final grade</li><li>Don't skip live sessions when possible</li></ul>",
